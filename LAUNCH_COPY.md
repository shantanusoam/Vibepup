**Tweet 1:**
Meet Vibepup. The first AI agent harness that actually listens.

Most agents get stuck in loops or overwrite your prompts. Vibepup uses a Split-Brain architecture to keep your intent separate from execution state.

Loyal. Safe. Vibe-coding ready.

Try it now:
`bunx vibepup new "flappy bird clone"`

Split-Brain architecture:
Your requirements live in `prd.md`. The agent's messy trial-and-error lives in `prd.state.json`.

You can change requirements while it is coding, and it does not lose track.

**Tweet 3:**
Anti-Wizard Protocol:
Vibepup kills any process that tries to ask for user input. No more hanging terminals.

DX-first. Good pup.

## Product Hunt

**Title:** Vibepup
**Tagline:** The loyal, split-brain AI agent for vibe coders.

**Description:**
Coding with AI agents usually feels like babysitting. They get stuck in loops, overwrite your instructions, or hang on interactive CLI prompts.

We built Vibepup to be the Good Pup of AI engineering.

**The Vibepup Difference:**
- Split-Brain architecture: Separate Human Intent (`prd.md`) from Agent State.
- Watchdog protocol: Automatically stops hanging processes.
- Vibe-coding native: Zero setup. Run it and let it ship.

**Modes:**
1. Plan: Maps your repo architecture.
2. Build: Executes your checklist one item at a time.
3. Watch: Waits until you update the PRD.
